  ## Installation
  This Social Network API requires the use of MongoDB and Node.js. After installing Node.js and MongoDB, you must install the node modules: express (server functionality) and mongoose (a wrapper for interacting with our database created with MongoDB). 

  After installing, open the intergrated terminal from the Main folder and enter `npm run start`. A console log will display indicating the port number that the server is live at.

  You can test the server in Insomnia to ensure that routes are working creatly and what JSON is being passed back when fetched from the front end.

  I have made a video demo below that tests the API in Insomnia.
